# Cybernetic Ecologies Project - Claude Code Governance

## Project-Specific Cybernetic Principles

This project embodies the **Third Wave of AI Coding** and should serve as a reference implementation of cybernetic ecology principles.

### Core Project Objectives
- **Demonstrate cybernetic governors** in action
- **Create reusable patterns** for community adoption  
- **Establish ethical framework** for responsible AI collaboration
- **Build antifragile competitive advantage** through ecosystem thinking

### Development Approach
- **Framework-first thinking**: Patterns before implementations
- **Recursive documentation**: Every component should be self-explaining
- **Community-oriented design**: Build for ecosystem network effects
- **Learning-focused**: Capture insights for framework evolution

### Coding Standards
- **Markdown excellence**: Clear, structured, reusable documentation
- **Pattern libraries**: Create templates others can adapt
- **Cross-references**: Link related concepts across documents
- **Version governance**: Track framework evolution systematically

### Strategic Considerations
- **Anthropic ecosystem alignment**: Design for platform amplification
- **Community adoption**: Lower barriers to framework application
- **Academic rigor**: Cite theoretical foundations properly
- **Business impact**: Demonstrate real-world value creation

### Quality Governors
- **Theoretical coherence**: Align with cybernetic principles
- **Practical applicability**: Provide actionable guidance
- **Ethical consistency**: Maintain Haraway/Bateson/Beer values
- **Strategic value**: Support ecosystem network effects

This project should exemplify **"We create ecologies, not programs"** in every component.
