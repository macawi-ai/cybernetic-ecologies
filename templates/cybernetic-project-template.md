## Cybernetic Governor Templates

### Environmental Governor Pattern
```bash
# Detects environment and adapts behavior automatically
environmental_governor() {
    context=$(detect_environment)
    case $context in
        development)   apply_dev_config ;;
        staging)       apply_staging_config ;;
        production)    apply_prod_config ;;
        *)            use_adaptive_config ;;
    esac
}
```

### Error Recovery Governor Pattern
```bash
# Self-healing when primary approach fails
error_recovery_governor() {
    if ! primary_method; then
        if ! secondary_method; then
            graceful_degradation
            learn_from_failure_pattern
            strengthen_system
        fi
    fi
    monitor_system_health
}
```

### Learning Governor Pattern
```bash
# Captures patterns and improves responses
learning_governor() {
    pattern=$(analyze_recent_interactions)
    if pattern_strength > threshold; then
        if pattern_positive; then
            amplify_successful_behavior
        else
            adapt_to_prevent_negative_pattern
        fi
        update_knowledge_base
    fi
}
```

### Quality Governor Pattern
```bash
# Maintains standards through validation
quality_governor() {
    quality_metrics=$(assess_system_quality)
    if quality_degraded; then
        identify_degradation_source
        apply_corrective_measures
        validate_improvement
        document_learning
    fi
}
```

### Meta-Governor Pattern
```bash
# Governs other governors
meta_governor() {
    for governor in environmental error_recovery learning quality; do
        effectiveness=$(measure_governor_performance $governor)
        if effectiveness < threshold; then
            optimize_governor $governor
            test_governor_improvement
        fi
    done
}
```

## Domain-Aware Architecture Patterns

### Simple Domain Pattern
```bash
# Best practices, predictable outcomes
simple_domain_handler() {
    apply_standard_procedure
    validate_expected_outcome
}
```

### Complicated Domain Pattern
```bash
# Good practices, expertise required
complicated_domain_handler() {
    analyze_situation
    apply_expert_knowledge
    systematic_implementation
    measure_results
}
```

### Complex Domain Pattern (Primary Focus)
```bash
# Emergent practices, probe-sense-respond
complex_domain_handler() {
    safe_to_fail_experiment
    sense_results_and_patterns
    respond_based_on_learning
    amplify_successful_approaches
}
```

### Chaotic Domain Pattern
```bash
# Crisis management, act-sense-respond
chaotic_domain_handler() {
    immediate_stabilizing_action
    sense_emerging_patterns
    respond_to_establish_order
    transition_to_complex_handling
}
```

### Context-Switching Governor
```bash
# Senses domain and adapts approach
context_aware_governor() {
    domain=$(sense_current_domain)
    case $domain in
        simple)      simple_domain_handler ;;
        complicated) complicated_domain_handler ;;
        complex)     complex_domain_handler ;;
        chaotic)     chaotic_domain_handler ;;
        *)          probe_to_determine_domain ;;
    esac
}
```

## Antifragile Design Patterns

### Redundancy Pattern
```bash
# Multiple pathways for critical functions
redundant_execution() {
    primary_path || secondary_path || tertiary_path || graceful_failure
}
```

### Optionality Pattern
```bash
# Maintain multiple options, exercise best one
optionality_manager() {
    maintain_multiple_approaches
    evaluate_current_context
    select_optimal_approach
    preserve_unused_options
}
```

### Overcompensation Pattern
```bash
# Get stronger from stress
stress_response_governor() {
    if stress_detected; then
        immediate_adaptation
        strengthen_weak_points_discovered
        increase_capacity_beyond_previous_level
    fi
}
```

---

## Information Flow Architecture

### Sensor Pattern
```bash
# Collect environmental data
information_sensor() {
    raw_data=$(collect_environmental_signals)
    filtered_data=$(remove_noise $raw_data)
    meaningful_patterns=$(extract_patterns $filtered_data)
    distribute_intelligence $meaningful_patterns
}
```

### Processor Pattern
```bash
# Transform data into actionable intelligence
information_processor() {
    input_data=$1
    contextual_analysis=$(analyze_context $input_data)
    pattern_recognition=$(identify_patterns $input_data)
    actionable_intelligence=$(synthesize_insights $contextual_analysis $pattern_recognition)
    echo $actionable_intelligence
}
```

### Distributor Pattern
```bash
# Route information to decision points
information_distributor() {
    intelligence=$1
    for decision_point in $(identify_relevant_decision_points $intelligence); do
        route_intelligence $intelligence $decision_point
    done
}
```

---

## Recursive Architecture Patterns

### Fractal Component Pattern
```bash
# Each component contains full cybernetic pattern
fractal_component() {
    # Every component has its own:
    environmental_sensing
    error_recovery
    learning_mechanism
    quality_control
    meta_regulation
    
    # While participating in larger system
    coordinate_with_parent_system
    manage_child_components
}
```

### Recursive Learning Pattern
```bash
# Learning at every level
recursive_learning() {
    # Learn at component level
    component_learning
    
    # Learn at system level
    system_level_learning
    
    # Learn at meta-system level
    meta_learning_about_learning
    
    # Apply insights recursively
    propagate_learning_insights
}
```

---

## Validation Framework

### Governor Health Check
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Test that all governors are functioning

echo "🔍 Cybernetic Governor Health Check"

# Test each governor type
for governor_type in environmental error_recovery learning quality meta; do
    if test_governor_function $governor_type; then
        echo "✅ $governor_type governor functioning"
    else
        echo "❌ $governor_type governor needs attention"
        diagnose_governor_issue $governor_type
    fi
done

# Test governor interactions
echo "🔍 Testing governor coordination..."
test_governor_interactions

# Test meta-governance
echo "🔍 Testing meta-governance..."
test_meta_governance_function

echo "📊 Governor Health Summary"
generate_governor_health_report
```

### Ecosystem Vitality Metrics
```bash
# Key indicators of ecosystem health
ecosystem_vitality_check() {
    echo "🌱 Ecosystem Vitality Metrics"
    
    adaptation_rate=$(measure_adaptation_velocity)
    echo "Adaptation Rate: $adaptation_rate"
    
    resilience_score=$(test_system_resilience)
    echo "Resilience Score: $resilience_score"
    
    learning_velocity=$(measure_learning_rate)
    echo "Learning Velocity: $learning_velocity"
    
    emergence_indicators=$(detect_emergent_behaviors)
    echo "Emergence Indicators: $emergence_indicators"
    
    overall_health=$(calculate_ecosystem_health)
    echo "Overall Ecosystem Health: $overall_health"
}
```
